EnsembleSVM

EnsembleSVM is a library providing an API to implement ensemble
learning use Support Vector Machine (SVM) base models. The package
contains some executable tools which behave similar to standard
SVM learning algorithms.

The package is self-contained in the sense that it contains most
necessary tools to build a pipeline for binary classification. Most
notable features include bootstrap sampling, cross-validation and
ensemble training/prediction.

The EnsembleSVM webpage contains all sorts of useful information at:

For installation instructions, please refer to the file INSTALL or
our webpage. Our webpage also contains an elaborate user manual and
some use cases to familiarise users with the software.
